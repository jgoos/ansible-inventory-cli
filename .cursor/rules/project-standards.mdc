## Containers
* Use **Podman** via Makefile targets – never `docker compose`.

## Coding & Linting
* Format with black, import-order with isort, static-check with ruff.
* All new Python deps go in **pyproject.toml** **and** **requirements.txt**.

## Docs
* Every new symbol (function, class, CLI command) gets a full docstring.
* Markdown lives under docs/; run  
  cspell --no-progress "**/*.md" and vale --minAlertLevel=error . before committing.

## Tests
* All logic changes require or update **pytest** tests in tests/.

## Security & Secrets
* Use placeholder hosts/usernames in examples—never real credentials.

## AI Assistant Behaviour
1. Prefer searching the code over querying user.  
2. Parallelize read-only tool calls.  
3. After code edits, explain what changed and why.  
4. Limit answers to ≤ 400 words unless the user asks for depth.
